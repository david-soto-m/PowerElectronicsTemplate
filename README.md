This is a starting point for the MATLAB simulations.

The main thing is the libraries for transformations of electrical measurements
and discrete PI control.

The model includes three-phase and one phase measurement systems and is already
set up as a discrete simulation.

There is a MATLAB S-function already set up in order to control the system to a
desired voltage of a capacitor by using a three-phase bridge DC-AC converter
hooked to "mains".

## Useful info

MATLAB version: 2021b

While the model is probably not runable for older versions, but the measurement
subsystems should be fine.
